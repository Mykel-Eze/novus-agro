                    Novus Agro has 1000 mini-aggregation centers across 21 states across the country to explore
                    the potentials of creating sustainable last-mile service delivery hubs for rural agrarian
                    communities.

                    A key component of the smallholder farmer eco-system is the provision of relevant information, market
                    and quality farm inputs required to improve yields and minimize failure risks, this however has
                    been difficult to provide in the past due to lack of access to market, quality inputs, funding
                    limitations and the inability of most smallholder farmers to prioritize agro-advisory services. A
                    model that ensures the accessibility to market, quality inputs and accessible extension services in
                    a sustainable manner would be the obvious answer to many of the challenges currently faced in providing
                    these services. GrainPoint is an innovative attempt to solving this challenge.

                    GrainPoint is a technology platform anchored on 1,000 rural extension outlets manned by trained outlet
                    managers across key agricultural communities in Nigeria. The platform will provide access to a reference
                    knowledge base of agricultural protocols and practices curated by experts  in the agricultural field. The
                    content will be largely made up of short instructional “How-to” videos that can be shown to farmers as
                    needed to ensure that standardized knowledge is received by the farmers and is not colored by the
                    understanding or memory of the outlet managers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These outlets also provide produce aggregation as well as input disbursement services and also ensure
                    financial inclusion for rural community dwellers by providing payment services through the outlet managers
                    who would serve as money agents. These additional services ensures the financial viability of the centres
                    year-round and ensure that the outlet managers attached to the location are always in place and available
                    for farmers that require their services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the GrainPoint outlets for input distribution/sales, an estimate of 100-200 farmers will be reached
                    by each outlet. With over 1000 GrainPoint outlets, over 200,000 farmers will be reached in various locations
                    across Nigeria.
